VoConfig
--------

To use it:

./voconfig.py -f vo_data.conf 

Notes:

1) Suggest you use VomsSnooper to prepare the VOMS coordinates for your vo.d
directory. That's in GitHub too.

2) Check carefully the data file by hand. The rules are:
- any name used in one VO should not be used in any other VO
- BLOCKNAME and NAME must be unique (this is covered by the rule above, if you think about it)
- NAME3 <= 3, NAME5 <= 5, NAME8 <= 8
- Names (not blockname)_should_ never end in a digit (geant4 and na48 are broken, I think). See NA62.
#
I'll build this validation into the program soon. For now, just watch your step.

3) VO Field order for the data file:

blockname     - name in caps
gid           - id of group
pgid          - id of prd group
sgid          - id of sgm group
pilgid        - id of pil group (if any)
name          - long name of vo
name3         - max 3 letter name, short stub
name5         - max 5 letter name, long stub
name8         - max 8 letter name, used for group
users         - number of users
prd           - number of prd user
sgm           - number of sgm users
pil           - number of pilot users
lcgadmin      - add role for /ROLE=lcgadmin
production    - add role for /ROLE=production`
pilot         - add role for /ROLE=pilot
